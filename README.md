This repository contains Pytorch implementation of [DeFraudNet:End2End Fingerprint Spoof Detection using Patch Level Attention](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/9087828/9093261/09093397.pdf)
Fingerprint spoofing is a technique in which fake fingerprints are created or obtained illegally to circumvent devices secured using these fingerprints. This feild has seen exemplary improvements in the recent past and is still improving as the spoofing system is also becoming advanced. Various methods have been developed which obtain state-of-the-art results on spoof detection when tested on same material fingerprints.

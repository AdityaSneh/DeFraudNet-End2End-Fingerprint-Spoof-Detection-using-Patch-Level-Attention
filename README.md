# DeFraudNet-End2End-Fingerprint-Spoof-Detection-using-Patch-Level-Attention
This repository contains Pytorch implementation of [DeFraudNet:End2End Fingerprint Spoof Detection using Patch Level Attention](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/9087828/9093261/09093397.pdf).

Fingerprint spoofing is a technique in which fake fingerprints are created or obtained illegally to circumvent devices secured using these fingerprints. This feild has seen exemplary improvements in the recent past and is still improving as the spoofing system is also becoming advanced. Various methods have been developed which obtain state-of-the-art results on spoof detection when tested on same material fingerprints. DeFraudNet obtains state-of-the-art results in not only fingerprint spoof detection when tested on the same material subjects but also obtains state-of-the-art cross-sensor, cross-material, cross-dataset results. 

## DeFraudNet Network Overview

DefraudNet network mainly uses DenseNets as the base networks. The complete overview of the network can be seen in the figure below.
